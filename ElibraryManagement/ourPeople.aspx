                        <h3>Dr. Chanta Marunga</h3>
                        <p> Hi, I’m Dr Bruno Mars,  Originally from Ireland, I grew up on a rural dairy farm in the south west of Ireland.
                            From a young age I have loved animals of all shapes and sizes. In 2000 I fulfilled a life long ambition by travelling 
                            to Australia and backpacked around the country and fell in love with the place and its people.  When the opportunity presented to move 
                            here permanently in 2010 my wife and I jumped at the chance.  Presently I live by the coast at Brighton and you will 
                            find me most mornings walking my dog (Boycey a Labrador) along the beach.

                        <h3>Lambi Judai (Head Nurse)</h3>
                        <p> Hi, I’m Emma. Originally from New Zealand, 
                            I have been living in Adelaide for the last 7 years. I have my Certificate IV in Veterinary Nursing, Diploma in Critical Care and a 
                            Certificate IV in Companion Animal Services (Positive Based Dog Training).
                            I started working at Friendly Vets in November 2017 and run our puppy preschool classes.  
                            My passion is dog training/behaviour and I enjoy keeping up-to-date with the latest information.
                            A highlight of my career was during 2010 when volunteered at Animals Asia in China. I spent 3 months there caring for rescued Asian Black Bears .
                            My fur family consists of a black and white cat called George, who I hand-raised from a couple of weeks old. I also have an Australian Shepherd puppy, Finn.

                        <h3>Teri Maata (Vet Nurse)</h3>
                        <p> Hi, I am Teri Maata. I have had the privilege of working in the veterinary industry for over 17 years.
                            I have my Certificate IV in veterinary nursing and diploma in Frontline Management. Previously I have worked and 
                            a few clinics and most recently at VetPay. Since joining the fantastic team at Port Road Vets (in 2018) 
                            I am enjoying getting back into clinical work. My passion is the bond between people and their pets.
                            My four-legged family includes: Kelly – a Tenterfield terrier, Zachery – a domestic short hair cat and Princess Portia – a Devon Rex.
                            I love to have a chat and look forward to learning you and your pets’ stories when you come in.
